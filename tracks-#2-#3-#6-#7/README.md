# Tracks #2, #3, #6 and #7

Tracks #2, #3, #6, and #7 are all used for documenting the details of vaccine administration to patients. Tracks #2 and #6 are for submitting individual patient bundles while tracks #3 and #7 are for submitting multiple patients' data. 

The Immunization FHIRÂ® Connectathon 2025 will use the **draft** [Immunization FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/immunizationfhirig/index.html) with references pointing to the **draft** [PH Core FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/artifacts.html).

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Immunization FHIR IG and PH Core FHIR IG are made available for this track in initial draft forms with limited resources - The IGs are not suitable for production use or advanced testing.**

## FHIR Servers available for testing

Track | Version | Server | Endpoint
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
Track #2 and #3 | R4 | UPM SILab (FHIRLab) |https://cdr.fhirlab.net/fhir 
Track #6 and #7 | R4 | Pointwest (SEIR)    |https://hapifhir-api-128112993769.asia-southeast1.run.app

Note: FHIRLab is an open interoprability sandbox. FHIR server in FHIRLab will remain accessible for testing and on-going learning activites post connectathon.

## Additional tools provided for connectathon

The tools below allow you to perform experimentation immediately and interact with others. They are the preferred method of exploring FHIR at the connectathon.

- [Postman Collection](../sample-data) 
- [FHIR validator](https://validator.fhirlab.net)
- [Sample JSON files for PH Core profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/artifacts.html#example-example-instances)

## Activity 2: Validate and submit a FHIR Bundle resource for an individual patient

| 3    | Create a Resource `Bundle` for an individual patient| A bundle is a container for a collection of resources. Use provided examples.|
| 4    | `$validate` the Resource Bundle                     |                                                                       |
| 5    | Submit `Bundle` to FHIR Server                      |                                                                       |

### Use Case Success
- Created a Bundle for an individual patient
- IG validation is passed and server returns 200 OK
- Bundle posted to server and returns HTTP 201 Created
