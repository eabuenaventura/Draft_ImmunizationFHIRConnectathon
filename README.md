The 2025 Immunization FHIR® Connectathon is hosted and co-organized by the Standards and Interoperability Laboratory (UPM SILab), under the University of the Philippines Manila National Institutes of Health’s National Telehealth Center together with the Department of Health (DOH), with technical assistance from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and support from the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The Connectathon is part of UP Manila's Long Term Agreement with UNICEF with the first engagement about Interoperability Development and Implementation: Implementing a standards-based immunization Implementation Guide through the use of international terminology and data exchange standards.

The project's objectives are as follows:
- Develop the necessary interoperability resources to ensure linkage of SEIR with other systems. **(FHIR® Immunization Implementation Guide)**
- Develop a sandbox environment for testing and capacity building. **(FHIR® Test Environment)**
- Engage, capacitate, and support the EMR providers/developers and other system owners in adopting interoperability standards and connecting to SEIR. **(Immunization Connectathon)**
