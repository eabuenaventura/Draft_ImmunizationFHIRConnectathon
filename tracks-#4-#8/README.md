# Tracks #4 and #8

Tracks #4 and #8 will focus on maximizing the Immunization Module by retrieving Immunization patient data from the server. Track #4 will utilize the FHIRLab FHIR server and track #8 will utilize the SEIR FHIR server.

The Immunization FHIRÂ® Connectathon 2025 will use the **draft** [Immunization FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/immunizationfhirig/index.html) with references pointing to the **draft** [PH Core FHIR Implementation Guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/artifacts.html).

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Immunization FHIR IG and PH Core FHIR IG are made available for this track in initial draft forms with limited resources - The IGs are not suitable for production use or advanced testing.**

## FHIR Servers available for testing

Track | Version | Server | Endpoint
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
Track #4 | R4 | UPM SILab (FHIRLab) |https://cdr.fhirlab.net/fhir 
Track #8 | R4 | Pointwest (SEIR)    |https://hapifhir-api-128112993769.asia-southeast1.run.app

Note: FHIRLab is an open interoprability sandbox. FHIR server in FHIRLab will remain accessible for testing and on-going learning activites post connectathon.

## Additional tools provided for connectathon

The tools below allow you to perform experimentation immediately and interact with others. They are the preferred method of exploring FHIR at the connectathon.

- [Postman Collection](../sample-data) 
- [FHIR validator](https://validator.fhirlab.net)
- [Sample JSON files for PH Core profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/UP-Manila-SILab/ph-core/artifacts.html#example-example-instances)

## Activity 4: Utilize the Immunization Module and Retrieve Immunization Patient Data

| Step | Activity                                       | Notes                                                                 | 
|------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Recall the Immunization patient `ID`           | Patient logical ID was created after the bundle resource was successfully posted.|
| 2    | Setup access to test FHIR server               |                                                                       |
| 3    | Get `Immunization` Patient data                | /Immunization/?patient=Patient/{id}                                   |



### Use Case Success
- Obtained Immunization patient data from FHIR Server
- Obtained a list of patient's vaccine records
- FHIR server returns HTTP 200 OK
